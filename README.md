# HTTP Server

This is a simple HTTP server written in Rust ðŸ¦€ made by following the challenges specified in [Build your own HTTP server](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server) by [Codecrafters](https://app.codecrafters.io/)

---
Note: Though the challenges are specified in the Codecrafters course, the implementation is done in Rust by me and not by following any tutorial.
